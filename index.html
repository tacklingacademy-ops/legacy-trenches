            <p>Thurmond Moore dedicated forty years to shaping men, not just players, exemplifying a commitment rooted in faith and purpose.</p>
            <p>He coached NFL defensive lines for five teams. He trained 71 NFL players—including future Hall of Famers Aaron Donald and J.J. Watt. He created the Chest Pop Tackling System, reaching 50,000+ players worldwide.</p>
            <p>But this isn't a coaching manual. It's a story about faithfulness. About four decades of showing up in obscurity and excellence. About investing in souls—from high school fields to NFL training rooms—and refusing to separate faith from football.</p>

            "When we met Coach Moore he was a rare combination of wisdom, sassiness and compassion. He wanted you to think it was tough—and he was—yet just at the right moment he would show love. His knowledge of the game was undeniable, his ability to connect with young people was unmistakable, but yet there was Moore!<br><br>Coach Moore met Reed where he was at in skill level and as a person, but he was always asking for his commitment to be better, teaching him to be the best version of himself, reaching for his abilities and identifying his capabilities. Coach provided Reed with things as parents we did not. Coach Moore explored and developed Reed's passion for God and he is responsible for integrating this into everything Reed did. Some days they did not even talk about football—they talked about faith, family and relationships. Coach Moore became part of our family as we had front row seats to his commitment to grow our son in ways we never thought possible.<br><br>Our son's life was cut way too short but his involvement with Reed showed in everything Reed was. We have found pages of notes written by Reed from his conversations with Coach—the messages, the love, the Bible verses—all were treasured by Reed and are a testament to his love, respect and trust for Coach Moore. These special things were and are what gives us strength today to have forgiveness and faith from what he learned with Coach Moore and was always trying to teach us. Coach would always say: It is in God's hands now.<br><br>Our lives were and are forever changed the day we met Coach Moore. We are blessed and give gratitude for the divine intervention only God could plan. All gas and no breaks!"
